The Autocomplete assignment was originally developed by Matthew Drabick and [Kevin Wayne](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/contact/) of Princeton University for their COS 226 class. The introductory portion of this writeup was based off the writeup for the Princeton version of the assignment, which can be found [here](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/assignments/autocomplete.html). 

The assignment was restructured for use at Duke by UTA Austin Lu ’15, UTA
Arun Ganesh ‘17, and Prof. Jeff Forbes.
